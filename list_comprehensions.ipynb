List comprehensions provide an elegant way to replace many for loops with more succinct, declarative statements.  Consider the following function to create a list of the numbers 0 through 9 (yes, I know I could accomplish the same with `my_list = range(10)`, but bear with me. . . ):\n",

    "#### The inspiration for list comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of list comprehensions is a Python implementation of the mathematical notation for sets.  For example, the notation for set consisting of the squares of the integers 0 through 9 is: { x <sup>2</sup> | x &#8712; of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}}.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x <sup>2</sup>\" is the \\<expression\\>, \"| x &#8712;\"  equates to \"for x in\", and \"{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\" is a \\<sequence\\> corresponding to \"range(10)\" (or an equivalent list, set or generator).  List comprehensions are succinct, consolidating the logic in a single line instead of spreading it over several lines of code as in the function list_first_ten() above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended syntax; if clauses and extension of list comprehension to sets, dicts and generators\n",
    "##### If clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "If clauses can be added to determine which sequence elements are evaluated by the expression.  Adding \"if x%2 == 0\" to the previous example will cause each sequence element to be evaluated by the if clause which will evaluate as True only for multiples of two.  Only sequence elements which are evaluated as True by the if clause(s) will be passed to the expression, evaluated and added to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "  `\n",
    "  [x for x in range(10) if x %2 == 0]\n",
    "  `\n",
    "\n",
    "generates the following list: \\[0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\].  Adding a second if clause `%3 == 0` results in a list containing only multiples of 6, in this example only 0 and 6.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  `\n",
    "  [x for x in range(10) if x %2 == 0 if x %3 == 0]\n",
    "  `\n",
    "\n",
    "or, using a compound if expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "  `\n",
    "  [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0]\n",

As with all sets, there will be no duplicate elements and the order of elements is not guaranteed, the process is otherwise the same as for lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To create a dict you need to generate both a key and a value so the single expression is replaced by two expressions separated by a colon: \\<key expression\\> : \\<value expression\\>.  As with sets, also replace the \\[square brackets\\] with \\{braces\\}.\n",

    "Map provides a way of applying a function to each element of a list (or other sequence) to generate a new list with each element of the new list being the corresponding element of the input list as evaluated by the function.  The number of lists provided as arguments to map() must correspond to the number of function arguments and must be presented in the same order.  Consider the function below which consumes two arguments and returns the sum of the first argument added to the square of the second:\n",
